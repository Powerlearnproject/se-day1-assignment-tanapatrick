#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering likely involves designing, developing, and maintaining software using engineering principles, focusing on quality and user needs.
*It powers the software behind innovations like mobile apps, cloud computing, and AI.
*It ensures projects are completed efficiently, meeting deadlines and budgets.
*The field also drives economic growth, creating jobs and contributing significantly to the global economy

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The Birth of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)-  Structured programming laid the foundation for modern coding practices. It improved readability and maintainability, enabling larger, more complex programs. Languages like C (developed in the early 1970s) embodied these principles, influencing software design for decades.
2. The Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)- OOP made it easier to model real-world systems, reuse code, and manage complexity in large-scale projects. It became a cornerstone of software engineering, powering everything from GUIs to enterprise systems.
3.  Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) revolutionized how teams build software, emphasizing iterative development, frequent feedback, and flexibility. It aligned software engineering with fast-changing business needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Initiation- This is the phase where planning takes place, feasibility studies are conducted, scope and resources are assessed.
2. Requirements Analysis- This phase involves gathering and documenting what the software is intended for. Stakeholders provide inputs and deatiled reqirements.
3. Design and Implementation - This is the phase where the actual development takes place. It incudes architecture, user interfaces, data models and technical specifications.
4. Testing and deployment- This is the phase where the developed system is verified to be working as intended and finally releasing the final product to the intended users.
5. Maintenance- This is the final step wherby the developers offer ongoing support of the system by fixing bugs, updating features and adapting the system to new features throughout its life cycle.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

*Waterfall methodology focuses on a linear and sequential approach whereby each phase must be completed before moving to the next stage. This methodology is mostly applied in projects with fixed, well-defined requirements and little-to-no expected changes e.g., in the development of a medical device i.e pacemaker.
*Agile methodology focuses on an iterative and incremental approach. It emphasizes on flexibility, collaboration and customer fedback. The testing is done as the project continues to ensure no setbacks at the end of the project. It is best implemented when develoing projects with evolving requirements or uncertain outcomes e.g., in the development of a consumer mobile app i.e.,social media platform.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

*Software developer- This is mastermind behind the coding. They write code to turn ideas into functional software.
*Quality Assurance Engineer- This is the officer who ensures that the software is of the expected quality and that it reaches the standards required by the users before being deployed.
*Project Manager- This is the person in-charge of overseeing the project to completion. They ensure the schedule, scope and budget are all in line according to the initial plan ensuring deadlines are met.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

*IDEs are a key requirement in software development as the offer pros such as Unified workflow which reduces context switching, productivity boost, debugging power, customization and also consistency in the development process. Examples include VS Code, Eclipse among others.
*VCSs are important in software development as they make the development process easier by allowing collaboration among developers, history tracking, reversibility, branching and merging and accoountability and review. They enable developers to store and review their code afterwards and even perform changes where necessary.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

*Some of the common challenges include:
- Scope creep and changing requirements- This can be countered by having effective change management processes and clearly definined requirements.
- Rapid tech changes- This challange can be countered by adopting continuous learning and using tech spaces to their advantage in order to be up-to-date. Experimenting in sandboxes is also a great practice to avoid issues.
- Time management and deadlines- Balancing all the work entailed may lead to a burnout. This can be countered by breaking down tasks and having reasonable timelines to finish the project.
- Ensuring code quality under pressure- This is a big issue which can be eliminated through pair programming where peers can pin-point mistakes made and correct them before going live or deployment.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

*Unit testing- This refers to testing of individual components or functions of the software in isolation. It is typically done during coding. It ensures: 1. Early bug detection. 2. Code confidence. 3. Speed.
*Integration system testing- This involves testing how multiple units or modules work together after they have been individually validated. It combines units and tests their interactions. Its importance include: 1. Interface validation. 2. Catches integration bugs. 3. Builds trust.
*System testing- Involves testing the fully integrated software as a complete system to verify it meets specified requirements. Its imporance include: 1. Risk reduction i.e shipping a system that may crash under heavy traffic. 2. Requirements alignment.
*Acceptance testing- This is a test to ensure that the software meets the users needs and business goals usually done by QA Engineer.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

*Prompt engineering is the practice of designing, crafting, and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models. The importance include:
1. Precision and clarity- Interaction ensures the AI delivers exactly what is needed, reducing back-and-forth.
2. Reducing errors and bias- Well-crafted prompts minimize false negatives and false positives hence improving reliability.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

*Vague- Tell me about software
*Clear- Explain the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle with examples
The improved prompt is more effective as it specifies exactly what is needed. The vague prompt is broad and will not give a desired result.
